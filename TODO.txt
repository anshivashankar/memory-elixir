Stuff to do left:
  - Clean up the active players UI. (they are appended together, make a list thingy instead)
  - Fix the scoring system, doesn't seem to work, no win state.
  - Dont allow the game to start unless there are two players.
  - Fix the fact that the second player goes first.
  - Add a button that allows you to go back to the lobby.
